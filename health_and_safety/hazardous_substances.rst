Hazardous Substances
====================

Any person who introduces, or manufactures, a source of hazard in the Hackerspace
has a duty towards the control of the hazard and the eventual safe disposal of
the material. Accurate records must be maintained.

Persons who obtain hazardous substances must obtain from the supplier a
statement detailing the known or potential hazards associated with the
substance, the recommended precautions and control measures. Such information,
in the form of Safety Data Sheets, must be made available by law by the
supplier.

A risk assessment for all work activities involving hazardous substances must
be prepared before work commences, as required by the Control of Substances
Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations. The directors must be notified before
new hazardous substances are introduced to allow for adequate risk assessment.

All hazardous substances must be stored and labelled appropriately.

Biological or radiation hazards should not be introduced or used in the
Hackerspace.
