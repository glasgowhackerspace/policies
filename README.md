View these documents at https://wiki.glashack.space/doku.php?id=about:health-and-safety

Structure:

  * Health and Safety: policies that follow from the company's legal responsibilies for health and safety.
  * Organisation: policies that we have voluntarily created as a group.
  * Activities: additional rules or guidance for specific activities.

Style guide:

  * This document is intended to be read by ordinary users of the Hacklab.
  * Use plain English.
  * Keep it simple.
  * Policies should be proportional and realistic, or they will be ignored.
  * Don't spend time describing legal frameworks. If extra information is relevant to the directors, document it elsewhere and link to it in footnotes.

Change policy:

  * There is no formal approval policy at this time.
  * Any documentation is better than no documentation.
  * At some point, the directors may freeze an approved version and we will start using pull requests.
