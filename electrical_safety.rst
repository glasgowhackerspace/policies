Electrical Safety
=================

Any electrical equipment that has the potential to cause injury is maintained
in a safe condition.

All users of equipment must perform basic visual checks on electrical equipment
prior to use to ensure there is no damage to plugs, cabling or equipment
casings. Any issues should be reported as a fault and the equipment taken out
of service.

Equipment should be appropriately fused.

Fixed Electrical Supplies
-------------------------

South Block are responsible for the safety of the fixed electrical installation
and this must not be modified by members.

Any damage to the fixed electrical supplies should be immediately reported to
the Directors who will inform building management.

Counterfeit, Non CE Compliant
------------------------------------------------------

There is a high risk from equipment that fails to meet European safety
standards.  This may be equipment ordered from eBay and AliExpress but also
includes some items such as low cost phone chargers which are often imported
with fake compliance certificates.

Counterfeit equipment should not be used in the Hackerspace. It can often be
identified by spelling mistakes or incorrect symbols on the device. Plugs may
not be of the correct dimensions and fuses incorrectly manufactured in these
cases.

Extensions and Adaptors
-----------------------

Only fused multi way extensions connected to a wall socket via a cable may be
used. These must not be daisy chained. Long extensions should be secured to
prevent wear and not become a trip hazard.

Faulty Equipment
--------------------------------------

All faulty equipment should be taken out of service and labelled to prevent
use by others.
